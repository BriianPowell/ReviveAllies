Allows you to revive your friends at their tombstone within a sixty second respawn window.

### USAGE
On death, your friends can interact with your tombstone within your respawn window in order to revive you at your point of death.
You can force respawn and forgo the revive by pressing your "Use" key (E).

### CONTRIBUTING

There's a lot of work to be done as the mod is in a barebones, working state. Feel totally free to both poke holes at the existing implementation, and submit pull requests to fix issues and improve abstractions.
